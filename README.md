# ML_Heart_Disease_Prediction
Machine learning python project created to predict heart disease. 
* The predicition result is an variable between 1 and 4, where 1 stands for healthy patient and 4 stands for patient with heart disease. 
* I used a LogisticRegression classifier beacuse it showed the best results for me, but if u want u can try a diffrent ones like RandomForestClassifier, SGDClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor, KNeighborsClassifier
